# Executive Summary: Fellowship-First Refactor
## Gathered Product Roadmap

**Strategic Shift:** From generic Christian app → Deep, useful youth fellowship platform

---

## 🎯 The Opportunity

**Problem:** Existing tools (WhatsApp, Instagram) lack spiritual context and engagement tracking for youth fellowships.

**Solution:** Gathered becomes the **spiritual context layer** for fellowship communities:
- Adds verses, devotions, check-ins to group chats
- Tracks spiritual engagement (not vanity metrics)
- Provides leader tools for community building
- Integrates seamlessly with existing platforms

**Target:** Youth fellowships (15-25 members) seeking deeper connection and engagement.

---

## 📊 Key Performance Indicator

### Fellowship Engagement Rate (FER)

**Formula:**
```
FER = (Posts×2 + Prayers×1.5 + Events×3 + Check-ins×1 + Devotions×2) / Members
```

**Target:** 15+ points per member per week

**Why it matters:**
- Measures **depth** of spiritual participation
- Encourages consistent community engagement
- Provides Stewards actionable insights
- Creates healthy competition through streaks/badges

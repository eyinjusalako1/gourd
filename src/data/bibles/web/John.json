    "The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.\n",

    "No one has seen God at any time. The one and only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.\n",
    "This is John’s testimony, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”\n",
    "He declared, and didn’t deny, but he declared, “I am not the Christ.”\n",
    "They asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?”\nHe said, “I am not.”\n“Are you the prophet?”\nHe answered, “No.”\n",
    "They said therefore to him, “Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”\n",

    "He is the one who comes after me, who is preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.”\n",

    "I didn’t know him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water: that he would be revealed to Israel.”\n",
    "John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven, and it remained on him.\n",
    "I didn’t recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’\n",

    "Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them,\n“What are you looking for?”\nThey said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), “where are you staying?”\n",

    "Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.\n",

    "Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”\n",
    "Jesus answered him,\n“Because I told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”\n",
    "He said to him,\n“Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”\n"
